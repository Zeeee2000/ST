First meeting was done with Sir in class where we discussed about the problems we are facing while setting up the project.

Task 4:
   1)Serenity:
If you need a Java-based framework that integrates with behavior-driven development (BDD) tools such as Cucumber and JBehave, Serenity BDD (formerly Thucydides) might be the tool for you. It's designed to make writing automated acceptance and regression tests easier.
It also lets you keep your test scenarios at a high level while accommodating lower-level implementation details in your reports.
   2)Cypress:
Compared to most of the other tools on this list, Cypress is a more developer-centric test automation framework that focuses on making test-driven development (TDD) a reality for developers. One of its design principles was to be able to package and bundle everything together to make the entire end-to-end testing experience pleasant and simple.
It has a different architecture than Selenium; while Selenium WebDriver runs remotely outside the browser, Cypress runs inside of it.
